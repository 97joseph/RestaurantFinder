Part 3 Add restaurants to favorite 

The user is able to click on any of the restaurant and add it to favorite. When the user clicks on the 
restaurant item, a notification alert should pop up to ask whether to add the selected item to favorite 
(See below). When the user selects yes on the alert dialog, the item is added to favorites. You must use 
the database we learned from the class to store these selected items. This means that your favorite 
items will not get deleted when you restart the application.
The favorite page can be found from the navigation drawer by swiping right on your screen. Your drawer 
must have a header and showing name of the application. Please check below for the application flow.
